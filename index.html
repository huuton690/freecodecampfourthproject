                    Introduction
                </h1>
                <p>
                    JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language.
                     It is a small and lightweight language. 
                     Inside a host environment (for example, a web browser), 
                     JavaScript can be connected to the objects of its environment to provide programmatic control over them.
                </p>
                <p>
                    JavaScript contains a standard library of objects, 
                    such as Array, Date, and Math, and a core set of language elements such as operators, 
                    control structures, and statements. 
                    Core JavaScript can be extended for a variety of purposes by supplementing it with additional objects; for example:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Client-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying objects to control a browser and its Document Object Model (DOM). 
                        For example, client-side extensions allow an application to place elements on an HTML form and respond to user events such as mouse clicks, 
                        form input, and page navigation.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Server-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying objects relevant to running JavaScript on a server. 
                        For example, server-side extensions allow an application to communicate with a database, 
                        provide continuity of information from one invocation to another of the application, or perform file manipulations on a server.

                </h1>
                <p>
                    You can declare a variable in three ways:
                </p>
                <p>
                    With the keyword var. For example,
                </p>
                <div>
                    <code>
                        var x = 42.
                    </code>
                </div>
                <p>
                    This syntax can be used to declare both local and global variables.
                </p>
                <p>
                    By simply assigning it a value. For example,
                </p>
                <div>
                    <code>
                        var x = 42.
                    </code>
                </div>
                <p>
                    This always declares a global variable. It generates a strict JavaScript warning. You shouldn't use this variant.
                </p>
                <p>
                    With the keyword let. For example,
                </p>
                <div>
                    <code>
                        let y = 13.
                    </code>
                </div>
                <p>
                    This syntax can be used to declare a block scope local variable. See Variable scope below.
                </p>
            </header>
        </section>
        <section class="main-section" id="variable_scope">
            <header class="main-header">
                <h1 class="title">
                    Variable scope
                </h1>
                <p>
                    When you declare a variable outside of any function, it is called a global variable, 
                    because it is available to any other code in the current document. When you declare a variable within a function, 
                    it is called a local variable, because it is available only within that function.
                </p>
                <p>
                    JavaScript before ECMAScript 2015 does not have block statement scope; rather, 
                    a variable declared within a block is local to the function (or global scope) that the block resides within. 
                    For example the following code will log 5, because the scope of x is the function (or global context) within which x is declared, 
                    not the block, which in this case is an if statement.
                </p>
                <div>
                    <code>
                        if (true) { var x = 5; } console.log(x); // 5
                    </code>
                </div>
                <p>
                    This behavior changes, when using the let declaration introduced in ECMAScript 2015.
                </p>
                <div>
                    <code>
                        if (true) { let y = 5; } console.log(y); // ReferenceError: y is not defined
                    </code>
                </div>
            </header>
        </section>
        <section class="main-section" id="global_variable">
            <header class="main-header">
                <h1 class="title">
                    Global variables
                </h1>
                <p>
                    Global variables are in fact properties of the global object. In web pages the global object is window, 
                    so you can set and access global variables using the window.variable syntax.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Consequently, you can access global variables declared in one window or frame from another window or frame by specifying the window or frame name. 
                    For example, if a variable called phoneNumber is declared in a document, you can refer to this variable from an iframe as parent.phoneNumber.
